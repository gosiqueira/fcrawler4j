<p>1/ RESERVATION PROCEDURES<br>The <a href="http://www.bleuvins.com" class='spip_url spip_out auto' rel='nofollow'>www.bleuvins.com</a> website presents tourist goods and services provided by various suppliers referenced by the BLEU VINS agency, such as accommodation providers, goods and service providers, rental providers, and goods and services offered by partnership organisations providing vehicle rental, air and train travel. For the goods and services offered, any conditions of sale specific to each supplier or partner organisation involved, shall apply over and above the present conditions on our website: such conditions may especially concern terms of payment, cancellation or changes in reservation, refunding, as well as the parties&#8217; liabilities and responsibilities under the contract. <br class='autobr' />
The client sets up his or her travel plans either by selecting one of the packages available on the site, or by entering into contact with the Bleu Vins team for a made-to-measure trip.<br class='autobr' />
After confirmation by the BLEU VINS agency that the selected goods and services are available and feasible, the client shall in turn confirm the reservation and carry out payment for the goods and services by means of a bank card for all trips reserved at least 45 days before departure. For reservations more than 45 days before departure, the client shall mandatorily make a payment equal to 30% of the total price of the stay. The remainder, or 70%, shall be paid no more than 45 days before departure. <br class='autobr' />
Subsequently, the client shall receive a confirmation e-mail from the BLEU VINS travel agency, as well as the invoice and the "TRAVEL PACK" with detailed information concerning the trip, at least 15 days before the start of the stay, except in the case of a last-minute reservation. The reservation confirmation form is equivalent to the trip contract, and contains a description of the goods and services and their main characteristics, as well as the price and conditions of cancellation and modification.</p>

<p>In order to confirm the reservation, one or several exchange vouchers shall be sent in the course of the week prior to the trip. The voucher or vouchers shall be presented to service providers (X) at each visit. The number of participants shown on the exchange vouchers shall serve as the basis for invoicing.</p>

<p>Airline companies may at all times demand prior payment with no possibility of a refund for tickets included in the package in the event of cancellation or modification. In such a case, or where the client requires early issue of his or her travel ticket, the modification and cancellation conditions may be changed: the BLEU VINS agency shall inform the client in accordance with provisions of the Tourism Law.<br class='autobr' />
The goods and services proposed on the website are updated as soon as information is received from suppliers; the reservation shall not be deemed definitive until the Agency has confirmed all of the goods and services included in the trip.<br class='autobr' />
In accordance with Art L. 121-20-4 of the Consumers Code, the client is not entitled to withdraw from tourist goods and services purchased online; but is entitled to modify, to cancel or to transfer such goods and services.</p>

<p>2/ INVOICING – PRICES  <br class='autobr' />
The descriptive data sheets of the trips and stays shall expressly make mention of what the price includes. The prices set in the travel contracts or booking forms are calculated on the basis of exchange rates, airline tariffs and goods and services on the ground applying at the time the contract is signed. They are sent in real-time upon publication on the Website.<br class='autobr' />
The prices given are indivisible and any goods and services included in a flat rate package that are waived, or any interruption of the trip through the responsibility of the client (including hospitalisation or early repatriation) shall not give rise to a refund, except in cases of specific insurance. <br class='autobr' />
The prices shown as "from" (minimum) correspond to flat rate prices per person over the current 12 month period, including tax, in euros. They shall be confirmed by the travel Agency at the time of enrolment.<br class='autobr' />
The prices shown correspond to a flat rate price per person, on the basis of a double or twin room, including taxes, in euros. They shall be confirmed by the travel Agency at the time of enrolment.<br class='autobr' />
Except where there is a special mention in the travel contract, prices do not include visa and passport costs, tips and miscellaneous gratifications, personal expenditure, vaccination costs, baggage excess charges, optional baggage insurance, cancellation and assistance, beverages, or certain mandatory goods and services such as local taxes etc.<br class='autobr' />
For travel tickets, the price to be paid is calculated on the basis of costs and taxes in force on the date of reservation; however they are subject to modification as a result of fuel surcharges or fiscal fees and local government taxes.<br class='autobr' />
For vehicle rental, the price to be paid corresponds to the options and terms selected by the client when making a reservation, mainly the vehicle rental and associated insurance; they do not take into account the cost of fuel or any other goods or services that the client may request when taking delivery of the vehicle. <br class='autobr' />
Payment of the trip is essential in order to ensure that the selected goods and services shall be available to the client. <br class='autobr' />

<p>4/ CHANGES<br class='autobr' />
Any change made to a trip that has been finalised and paid for may be carried out within the conditions set out in the present provisions.<br class='autobr' />
4-1. Changes at the request of the client<br class='autobr' />
All changes requested by the client shall give rise to a modification charge of 30 (thirty) euros including tax.<br class='autobr' />
A trip may be changed up until 15 days before the first day of the trip, unless stipulated otherwise by the service provider in question.<br class='autobr' />
The request for the change must be sent by e-mail or by land mail to the contact addresses given on the website of the agency in which the client purchased the trip.<br class='autobr' />
Certain changes, such as the date or the destination shall be considered and processed as cancellations (see paragraph 5 Cancellation below).<br class='autobr' />
In the event of partial cancellation of a trip involving one of the persons on the order form, any resulting changes such as changing a double room to a single room shall be paid for by the client before departure.<br class='autobr' />
Modification of goods and services by the client in the course of the trip shall not give rise to a refund, whether the trip has been shortened, or whether goods and services have not been used.<br class='autobr' />
4-2. Changes requested by the agency or by the trip supplier<br class='autobr' />
If before departure, an extraneous event as meant in Art L211-13 of the Tourism Law, obliges a trip supplier to modify an essential component of the contract drawn up between the Agency and the client, the Site shall notify the client by any means that provides proof of reception, as quickly as possible, and shall put forward substitute proposals (changes in the trip or substitute trip).</p>

<p>5/  TRANSFER<br class='autobr' />
Reassigning a trip to a third party is permissible except where there is a stipulation to the contrary by one of the service providers, on condition that the transferee satisfies the conditions required for the stay or the trip.<br class='autobr' />
All changes requested by the client shall give rise to a modification charge of 30 (thirty) euros including tax. <br class='autobr' />
The client shall mandatorily notify the Agency of any transfer of the contract, using any means that provides proof of reception, by the latest 15 days before the first day of the trip; the client shall provide a photocopy of the transferee&#8217;s or transferees&#8217; ID documents and addresses.<br class='autobr' />
However, certain components of the contract may not be transferred: insurance contract, vehicle rental, airline travel ticket (after the travel ticket has been issued, it may not be exchanged, nor refunded, by airline companies; consequently, transfer of the travel contract shall be treated as a cancellation under the terms set out in the supplier&#8217;s Special Conditions of Sale).</p>

<p>6 / CANCELLATION<br class='autobr' />
6-1. Cancellation by the organiser<br class='autobr' />
BLEU VINS reserves the right to cancel the stay in the following cases:<br /><img src="squelettes-dist/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;where the minimum number of persons taking up the offer required for validity of the stay has not been reached;<br /><img src="squelettes-dist/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;Payment has not been made by the client or clients in accordance with the payment schedule drawn up by BLEU VINS.<br /><img src="squelettes-dist/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;Default on the part of the local and/or incoming agency, unable to organise the package that was sold.<br /><img src="squelettes-dist/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;Special circumstances that may threaten the group&#8217;s safety (weather conditions, pandemic, political situation etc); force majeure.<br class='autobr' />
Cancellation on any one of the above grounds shall give rise to a total refund of the sums paid. <br class='autobr' />
6-2. Cancellation by the client <br class='autobr' />
The client may cancel his or her trip at any time after signing the sales contract for the trip or the booking form. Where a client or clients cancel more than 60 days before departure, 5% of the total price of the trip (including options) shall be retained, with a minimum 100€ amount per person.<br /><img src="squelettes-dist/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;	From 60 to 31 days before departure: 15% of the total price of the trip (including options), with a minimum € 200 charge per person (trips abroad) and €100 per person (trips in metropolitan France). <br /><img src="squelettes-dist/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;	From 30 to 21 days before departure: 35% of the total price of the trip (including options). <br /><img src="squelettes-dist/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;	From 20 to 14 days before departure: 50% of the total price of the trip (including options).<br /><img src="squelettes-dist/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;	From 13 to 7 days before departure: 75% of the total price of the trip (including options).<br /><img src="squelettes-dist/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;	Less than 7 days before departure: 100% of the total price of the trip (including options).</p>

<p>7 / ADMINISTRATIVE FORMALITIES<br class='autobr' />
Clients who are of French nationality, or belong to the EU or the EEA must ascertain that the documents, especially administrative and health documents required for the trip, are in line with information provided by the competent authorities.<br class='autobr' />
Foreign non-European nationals or persons not belonging to the EEA must apply to their local authorities, under their sole responsibility, in order to be aware of the formalities required for the planned trip.  It is not the responsibility of the agency to provide this type of information.<br class='autobr' />
Should the participants in the trip include minor children, the parents are responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory administrative requirements.<br class='autobr' />
This type of administrative and health information may change between the time of reservation and that of departure: therefore we recommend that clients check with competent authorities that they are in compliance, before departure. The agency can under no circumstances be held responsible should clients fail to observe any police, customs or health regulations pertaining to their trip.</p>

<p>8/ ACCOMMODATION<br class='autobr' />
Classification of the accommodation on offer: hotels and guest rooms, using stars or categories, shown in the agency&#8217;s accommodation offers, are decided upon by Tourist authorities, in accordance with local and international standards. <br class='autobr' />
In the event of theft at the place of accommodation, the liability of the agency will be bounded in accordance with French civil law.<br class='autobr' />
The images shown on the website are by way of illustrating the goods and services: the agency cannot guarantee that they are identical to the venues, goods and services reserved by the client.</p>

<p>9/ RAIL TRANSPORTATION<br class='autobr' />
Transportation terms are stated on the travel tickets or the communiqués issued to the client in their "trip notebook / Road book". All departure and arrival times are given by way of information, and may be changed by the carrier, even after confirmation. No unused seats, whether outward bound or return, can be refunded.<br class='autobr' />
After payment for the trip, the agency will provide the names and times of the transportation Company, and undertakes to inform the client without delay of any changes that may come to its knowledge. Rail transportation is subject to operating and safety constraints that may cause delays: we advise you to plan for sufficient time when catching a connecting train, and to take into account possible delays for your other engagements when departing and arriving.<br class='autobr' />
Transportation operators may at certain times be obliged to provide transportation along part of the line by means of passenger coaches, without change or hindrance to the type and purpose of the service provided.</p>

<p>10/ INSURANCE<br class='autobr' />
The Agency does not oblige clients to take out any insurance, except where there are legal or regulatory requirements for a service. <br class='autobr' />
The agency recommends that clients take out additional insurance covering risks specific to trips such as: illness, accidents, natural catastrophes, medical repatriation etc. <br class='autobr' />
In the event of an untoward incident in the course of the trip, it is up to the client to immediately contact his or her insurance company in compliance with the terms of the policy taken out, so as to enable the necessary measures, and to notify the agency by any means as soon as possible.</p>

<p>11/ LIABILITY<br class='autobr' />
The Agency holds legal and administrative permits issued by the competent French authorities, guaranteeing that clients will receive the goods and services in proper order.<br class='autobr' />
For flat rate or "package" tourist goods and services, liability of the supplier of the service is set out in Art .. 211-16 of the Tourism Law. Such liability cannot be invoked in the event of the client failing to fulfil the contract, through the fault of a third party, or in the event of force majeure. Force majeure is defined as any event extraneous to the parties, that is both unpredictable and unavoidable, preventing the client and/or the agency or its suppliers from providing all or part of the obligations stipulated in the contract (riots, wars, political unrest, health situations, pollution, natural and/or climate-related events) or technical incidents extraneous to the agency (strikes by airline personnel, airspace congestion, transportation delays, loss or theft of luggage and other belongings). Apart from tourist flat rate packages (e.g. separate vehicle rental), liability &#8217;as of right&#8217; set out in the above-mentioned Article cannot be invoked, in compliance with Art L. 211-16 of the Tourism Law.<br class='autobr' />
The Agency&#8217;s liability may be bounded by that of its own suppliers, by the application of international conventions, especially regarding transportation by air: the Warsaw Convention of 12 October 1929, amended, and the Montréal Convention of 28 May 1999 (Article L211-16 of the Tourism Law).<br class='autobr' />
The BLEU VINS agency cannot in any event be held responsible for untoward incidents occurring in the course of services purchased directly on the spot by the client from an outside supplier, or initiated by the client.</p>

<p>12/ COMPLAINTS <br class='autobr' />
For any problem arising from a failure to fulfil the contract, or improper execution of the contract, we invite you to file a complaint with the agency or its representative as soon as possible, by means of the contact information provided. In order to facilitate rapid processing of your complaint, it must be addressed to the agency by registered letter within 45 days of becoming aware of the prejudice.  <br class='autobr' />
The Agency cannot be held liable in the event of loss, theft, delay or deterioration of clients&#8217; luggage and personal belongings during the trip. As soon as a problem has been observed, we recommend that clients have the incident set out in writing by competent local authorities.</p>

<p>13/ INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND FREEDOM OF INFORMATION<br class='autobr' />
In application of Law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 pertaining to information technology, data files and freedom of information, clients are advised that travel dossiers are subject to nominative computer processing.</p>

<p>14/ APPLICABLE LAW AND TERRITORIAL COMPETENCY<br class='autobr' />
Contracts drawn up between the Agency and the client are exclusively subject to French law.<br class='autobr' />
The general and special conditions of sale are those provided in French and in English and published on the <a href="http://www.bleuvins.com" class='spip_url spip_out auto' rel='nofollow'>www.bleuvins.com</a> website. Any translation into another language shall be for information purposes only, and shall carry no legal weight. <br class='autobr' />
Any litigation and any legal action pertaining to the the company&#8217;s travel agency professional activities shall fall under the competency of the commercial tribunal at ANGERS.</p>

<p>15 / REVISED VERSIONS OF THE SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF SALE AND GOODS AND SERVICES OFFERS<br class='autobr' />
The applicable Conditions of Sale, both General and Special, shall be those in force on the day of full payment for the trip by the client.<br class='autobr' />
The agency reserves the right to modify or update the present conditions of sale at all times, without prior notice and with immediate effect.</p>

<p>16 / GIFT VOUCHERS VALIDITY<br>The Gift voucher have 12 month validity starting on the date of issue. According this validity, the customer is expressly informed that the services included can be redefined by the partners. After this delay, the Gift voucher’s owner can not ask for the service supply or any refund.</p><br/><br/>
